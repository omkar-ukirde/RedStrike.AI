# Android Pentesting Skill

## Goal

Assess the security of Android applications by analyzing their structure, identifying vulnerabilities, and attempting to exploit them.

## Methodology

1.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Decompilation:** Decompile the APK file using tools like `apktool` or `jadx` to get the source code and resources.
    *   **Manifest Analysis:** Analyze the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for misconfigurations, such as exported components, hardcoded secrets, or insecure permissions.
    *   **Source Code Review:** Review the decompiled Java/Kotlin code for vulnerabilities like insecure data storage, weak cryptography, or insecure communication.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Setup:** Install the application on a rooted Android device or an emulator.
    *   **Traffic Interception:** Intercept and analyze the application's network traffic using a proxy like Burp Suite or mitmproxy.
    *   **Filesystem Analysis:** Explore the application's data directory on the device (`/data/data/<package_name>`) to check for insecurely stored data.
    *   **Runtime Manipulation:** Use tools like `Frida` or `Xposed` to hook into the application's functions at runtime, bypass security controls, and manipulate its behavior.

## Tools

*   **apktool:** For decompiling and recompiling APKs.
*   **jadx:** A DEX to Java decompiler.
*   **adb (Android Debug Bridge):** To install apps, access the device shell, and manage files.
*   **Burp Suite/mitmproxy:** For intercepting network traffic.
*   **Frida:** A dynamic instrumentation toolkit.
*   **A rooted Android device or emulator.**

## Guidance for AI

*   When a user wants to test an Android application, this skill should be activated.
*   Guide the user through the process of setting up a testing environment.
*   Explain the difference between static and dynamic analysis.
*   Provide instructions on how to use the key tools, like `apktool` for decompilation and `Frida` for runtime analysis.
*   Help the user identify common Android vulnerabilities and how to test for them.
*   Emphasize the importance of having a rooted device or a properly configured emulator for dynamic analysis.

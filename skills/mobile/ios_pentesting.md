# iOS Pentesting Skill

## Goal

Assess the security of iOS applications by analyzing their structure, identifying vulnerabilities, and attempting to exploit them.

## Methodology

1.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Unpack the IPA:** The IPA file is a ZIP archive. Unzip it to access the application bundle.
    *   **Binary Analysis:** Analyze the application binary using tools like `otool` or `class-dump-z` to inspect classes, methods, and strings.
    *   **Plist Analysis:** Examine the `Info.plist` file for sensitive information and security settings.
    *   **Source Code Review:** If the source code is available (e.g., for a white-box assessment), review it for vulnerabilities.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Setup:** Install the application on a jailbroken iOS device.
    *   **Traffic Interception:** Intercept the application's network traffic with a proxy like Burp Suite.
    *   **Filesystem Analysis:** Explore the application's data directory in `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<AppID>` to find insecurely stored data.
    *   **Runtime Manipulation:** Use tools like `Cycript` or `Frida` to hook into the application's runtime, modify its behavior, and bypass security controls like jailbreak detection or certificate pinning.
    *   **Keychain Analysis:** Use tools like `keychain_dumper` to inspect the contents of the iOS keychain and see what data the application is storing there.

## Tools

*   **A jailbroken iOS device:** Essential for dynamic analysis.
*   **iFunBox/Filza:** To explore the device's filesystem.
*   **Burp Suite/mitmproxy:** For intercepting network traffic.
*   **Frida/Cycript:** For runtime manipulation.
*   **class-dump-z/otool:** For static analysis of the binary.
*   **keychain_dumper:** To dump keychain data.

## Guidance for AI

*   When a user wants to test an iOS application, this skill should be activated.
*   Emphasize that a jailbroken device is a prerequisite for most dynamic testing.
*   Guide the user through the process of setting up their testing environment and installing the necessary tools on the jailbroken device.
*   Explain how to perform both static and dynamic analysis.
*   Provide guidance on how to bypass common iOS security features like certificate pinning.
*   Help the user identify and test for common iOS vulnerabilities.

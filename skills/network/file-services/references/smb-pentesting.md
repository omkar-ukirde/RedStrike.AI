# SMB Pentesting Skill

## Goal

Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in SMB (Server Message Block) services on a target network.

## Methodology

1.  **Discovery:** Use tools like `nmap` or `smbclient` to find open SMB ports (139, 445).
2.  **Enumeration:** Enumerate shares, users, and other information from the SMB service. Tools like `smbclient`, `enum4linux`, or `nmap` scripts can be used.
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan for known SMB vulnerabilities, such as EternalBlue (MS17-010).
4.  **Exploitation:** If a vulnerability is found, attempt to exploit it using a framework like Metasploit.
5.  **Post-Exploitation:** If access is gained, perform post-exploitation activities like accessing shares or escalating privileges.

## Tools

*   **nmap:** For discovery and vulnerability scanning.
*   **smbclient:** For enumeration and interaction with SMB shares.
*   **enum4linux:** For detailed SMB enumeration.
*   **Metasploit:** For exploitation.

## Example Command

```bash
nmap -p 139,445 --script=smb-vuln* <target>
smbclient -L //<target>/
```

## Guidance for AI

*   When the user wants to test SMB services, this skill should be activated.
*   Follow the methodology to systematically test the target.
*   Prompt the user for the target IP.
*   Report findings at each step (e.g., open shares, identified vulnerabilities).
*   Be cautious with the exploitation step and ask for explicit user permission before attempting to exploit a vulnerability.

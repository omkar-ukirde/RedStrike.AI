# FTP Pentesting Skill

## Goal

Evaluate the security of FTP (File Transfer Protocol) services, identify vulnerabilities, and attempt to gain unauthorized access.

## Methodology

1.  **Discovery:** Find open FTP ports (usually port 21) using `nmap`.
2.  **Banner Grabbing:** Get the FTP server banner to identify the software and version.
3.  **Anonymous Login:** Check if anonymous login is enabled. If so, explore the accessible files.
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan for known vulnerabilities in the FTP server version.
5.  **Brute-force attack:** Attempt to guess usernames and passwords using tools like `hydra`.
6.  **Sniffing:** If the FTP connection is unencrypted, it may be possible to sniff credentials from the network.

## Tools

*   **nmap:** For port scanning and vulnerability scanning.
*   **ftp:** The standard FTP client to test for anonymous login and interact with the server.
*   **hydra:** For brute-force attacks.
*   **Wireshark:** for sniffing network traffic (if applicable).

## Example Command

```bash
nmap -sV -p 21 --script ftp-* <target>
hydra -L <user_list> -P <password_list> ftp://<target>
```

## Guidance for AI

*   When a user wants to test an FTP server, this skill should be activated.
*   First, check for anonymous login, as this is a common and easy-to-exploit misconfiguration.
*   If anonymous login is not enabled, guide the user through a brute-force attack.
*   Ask for the target, a list of potential usernames, and a password list.
*   Warn the user that FTP is an unencrypted protocol and credentials can be sniffed.
*   Report any files or directories that are accessible.

# SSH Pentesting Skill

## Goal

Assess the security of SSH (Secure Shell) services, identify weak configurations, and attempt to gain unauthorized access.

## Methodology

1.  **Discovery:** Identify open SSH ports (usually port 22) using `nmap`.
2.  **Banner Grabbing:** Obtain the SSH banner to identify the version of the SSH server.
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Check for known vulnerabilities in the identified SSH version.
4.  **User Enumeration:** Attempt to enumerate valid usernames.
5.  **Brute-force attack:** Attempt to guess passwords for valid users using a wordlist. Tools like `hydra` or `medusa` can be used.
6.  **Public Key Abuse:** Check for weak or leaked public keys.

## Tools

*   **nmap:** For port scanning and banner grabbing.
*   **hydra:** For brute-force attacks.
*   **medusa:** Another tool for brute-force attacks.
*   **Metasploit:** For user enumeration and exploitation of some vulnerabilities.

## Example Command

```bash
nmap -p 22 --script ssh-auth-methods,ssh-hostkey,ssh2-enum-algos <target>
hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> ssh://<target>
```

## Guidance for AI

*   When the user wants to test an SSH service, this skill should be activated.
*   Guide the user through the methodology, from discovery to brute-forcing.
*   Ask for the target, a username (or a list of usernames), and a password list for brute-force attacks.
*   Emphasize the importance of using a good password list and warn about the potential for account lockouts.
*   Report the success or failure of the brute-force attack.
